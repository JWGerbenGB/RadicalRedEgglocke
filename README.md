# What is an Egglocke?
An egglocke is very similar to a Nuzlocke, but it is different in the sense that instead of encountering a pokemon on a route, you must hatch a random egg from your box on that route.

# What are the rules?
1. You may hatch 1 egg per place from the encounter list. It must hatch at that place for it to count!
2. The egg you pick from your PC must be done at random, meaning no intentionally picking eggs which you know contain certain pokemon which you like.
3. If the pokemon you hatch from an egg has an alternate form in the boxes named "Forms 1", "Forms 2", "Forms 3", you may store the hatched pokemon in the "Illegal" box and pick one alternate form of that pokemon in the aforementioned boxes. You may only do this once and it must be done before the pokemon is used in battle.
4. You may not use gifted/bought pokemon or gifted/bought eggs.
5. If you encounter a shiny pokemon (buying a shiny pokemon does not count!), you may catch it and use it. This is the shiny clause. The shiny clause only applies once per route.
5.5 If you do get a shiny pokemon from an egg, you may hatch another egg at that route, this only applies once per route.
6. You are not allowed to use any pokemon present at the start of the rom, with the exception of the shiny ponyta named EggHatcher. EggHatcher may only be used to speed up hatching eggs thanks to its "Flame Body" ability.
7. The run is considered game over if you white out. If you die in a double partner and your partner does win, the run is still alive (if you have other pokemon left).
8. You may not exceed the level cap using rare candies (intentionally).
9. Nickname your pokemon upon it hatching from an egg.
10. If a pokemon faints, it is considered dead and must be put into the "Dead 1" or "Dead 2" PC box. It is not allowed to be taken out. If your pokemon is revived after a battle, it is still considered dead and must not be used in battle and must be stored into the appropriate box as soon as possible. If the pokemon does accidentally enter the battle, it must be switched out as its first move, if this is not available, it may be used till an oppurtunity arises to switch it out and it must be switched out the first turn it is able to.
11. [Egglocke Save Tool Generator Rule only] If you receive a duplicate pokemon from an egg, you may not reroll it and you may use both pokemon of the same species. (reason: This ony happens if a user specificaly allowed duplicates, which only happens if there are less than ~200 pokemon available to fill the egg slots.

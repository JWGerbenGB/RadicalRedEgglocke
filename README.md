# Radical Red Egglocke
A custom gamemode for the Rom hack Pokemon Radical Red.
Download link to the savefile is at in the files above.

# What is an Egglocke?
An egglocke is very similar to a Nuzlocke, but it is different in the sense that instead of encountering a pokemon on a route, you must hatch a random egg from your box on that route.

# Where to report bugs/issues?
If there are any bugs or issues, please privately message Gerben#4558 on discord. 
Do not bother the Radical Red (Development) Team with it, as they are not responsible for any issues that may arise from using the save file.

# Themed runs
If you do want to do a themed run, for example mono water or mono gen 7, there is a tool in the tools folder to create a save file with only eggs that follow your challenge. You can also make legendaries less common or outright disable certain categories (like disable any pokemon from gens 5-8, and ban all mythical pokemon). 

# What are the rules?
1. You may hatch 1 egg per place from the encounter list (see below). It must hatch at that place for it to count!
2. The egg you pick from your PC must be done at random, meaning no intentionally picking eggs which you know contain certain pokemon which you want/like.
3. If the pokemon you hatch from an egg has an alternate form in the boxes named "Forms 1", "Forms 2" or "Forms 3", you may store the hatched pokemon in the "Illegal" box and pick one alternate form of that pokemon in the aforementioned boxes. You may only do this once per pokemon and it must be done before the pokemon is used in battle.
4. You may not use gifted/bought pokemon or gifted/bought eggs.
5. If you encounter a shiny pokemon (buying a shiny pokemon does not count!), you may catch it and use it. This is the shiny clause. The shiny clause only applies once per encounter place.
5.5 If you do get a shiny pokemon from an egg, you may hatch another egg at that route, this only applies once per encounter place.
6. You are not allowed to use any pokemon present at the start of the rom, with the exception of the shiny ponyta named EggHatcher. EggHatcher may only be used to speed up hatching eggs thanks to its "Flame Body" ability.
7. The run is considered game over if you white out. If you die in a double battle and your partner does win, the run is still alive (if you have other pokemon left).
8. You may not exceed the level cap using rare candies or the daycare, if you do, you must store the pokemon in the "Alive 1" or "Alive 2" box till the level cap has increased and the pokemon's level is smaller or equal to the current level cap.
9. Nickname your pokemon upon it hatching from an egg. Tip: Make a nickname theme for a run such as occupations, this is not mandatory, but can be fun.
10. If a pokemon faints, it is considered dead and must be put into the "Dead 1" or "Dead 2" PC box. It is not allowed to be taken out. If your pokemon is revived after a battle, it is still considered dead and must not be used in battle and must be stored into the appropriate box as soon as possible. If the pokemon does accidentally enter the battle, it must be switched out as its first move, if this is not available, it may be used till an oppurtunity arises to switch it out and it must be switched out the first turn it is able to.
11. [Egglocke Save Tool Generator Rule only] If you receive a duplicate pokemon from an egg, you may not reroll it and you may use both pokemon of the same species. 
(reason: This ony happens if a user specificaly allowed duplicates, which only happens if there are less than ~200 pokemon available to fill the egg slots.)
